When to Use Reserves vs. When Not to Use Reserves
In DeFi swaps, reserves refer to the liquidity pool balances of tokens in an AMM (Automated Market Maker) like Uniswap or PancakeSwap. Whether we need to use reserves depends on the swap calculation method:

‚úÖ When to Use Reserves:
When calculating swap amounts using AMM formulas:

If using the constant product formula
```
(x * y = k)
```
we must use reserve balances to calculate precise amounts.
Example:
```
amount_out = (reserve_out * amount_in) / (reserve_in + amount_in) (adjusted for fees)
```
When estimating slippage and price impact:

Slippage depends on the size of the swap relative to the reserves.
Large swaps significantly shift the price, requiring reserve-based calculations.
When simulating a trade without on-chain execution:

Off-chain calculations (e.g., pricing models) need reserves to predict the expected output.

‚ùå When NOT to Use Reserves:
When analyzing a completed swap (post-trade analysis):

If transaction data already contains the exact amounts swapped, reserves are not needed.
We only need to work backward from the final output to find the required input.
When optimizing for a better starting input:

Instead of using pool reserves, we can reverse the swap flow (accounting for fees) using the actual transaction data.
This method works when we already know the amounts received in each step.
When dealing with token transfers instead of direct swaps:

If a transaction involves multiple transfers without interacting with a liquidity pool, reserves are unnecessary.
Why This Script Does NOT Use Reserves
The script analyzes a completed swap using recorded transaction amounts.
We already have the exact output received at each step.
Instead of estimating swap amounts using reserves, we reverse-calculate the input needed with a simple fee-adjusted division.
Thus, reserves are not required for this type of post-swap input optimization. üöÄ
